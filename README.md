This repository contains four tasks completed during my remote internship at CodeAlpha, demonstrating various Python programming skills.

## Task 1: Hangman Game

A classic word-guessing game where players guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

**Concepts Used:**
- Control Structures: Loops and conditionals to manage game flow.
- String Manipulation: Checking guessed letters and updating the display word.
- Lists: Tracking guessed letters and the word to be guessed.
- User Input: Handling user input for guesses.

## Task 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker

A tool for tracking the performance of stocks in a portfolio by fetching real-time stock prices and calculating the total portfolio value.

**Concepts Used:**
- APIs: Fetching real-time stock data.
- Data Processing: Manipulating and calculating stock prices and portfolio value.
- Error Handling: Managing potential errors when fetching data.
- JSON: Parsing and handling JSON data from API responses.

## Task 3: Basic Chatbot

A simple conversational agent that responds to user inputs with predefined replies, simulating basic interactive conversations.

**Concepts Used:**
- NLP (Natural Language Processing): Basic processing of user inputs.
- Dictionaries: Storing pairs of user inputs and corresponding bot responses.
- Loops: Maintaining conversation flow until the user decides to end it.

## Task 4: Task Automation

A script that automates the organization of files in a directory based on their file types, sorting them into subdirectories according to their extensions.

**Concepts Used:**
- File Handling: Using `os` and `shutil` modules to manipulate files and directories.
- Automation: Improving efficiency by automating repetitive tasks.
- Error Handling: Handling various file system errors gracefully.
